# Path-planning-using-voronoi-diagrams-for-JetBot

### This project is part of the course cse 276a - Introduction to Robotics at UCSD

### An important part of robotics is path and task planning. In this home work we will only consider path planning.

1. Setup an environment in a 10ft√ó10ft area with landmarks at the edges
    as show in the figure. The landmarks shold be similar to those used in
    HW2/3. Measure the position of your landmarks. Place an obstacle of
    size 1x1 - 2x2 ft in the middle of the workspace. The final setup should
    be similar to one shown below.
     
     
    
2. Design a voronoi based path planner to go from start to the 1st and
    2nd stops.
3. Provide a report that describes your chosen representation, the associ-
    ated algorithm, videos/images that document the results. Include your
    code in the report. What are the main limitations of the method for
    achieving a great performance?
